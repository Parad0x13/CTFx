Directory Buster (dirb) is a neat tool that allows you to scan the directories of a URL
It can find some files/folders that are there that you wouldn't otherwise know about

dirb [targetIP_or_URL]

You can have it scan all listable subdirectories with -w
You can also have it save to disk in a readable format with -o
dirb http://target -w -o dirb_out
